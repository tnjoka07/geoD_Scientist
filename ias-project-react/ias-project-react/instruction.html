1. Cloned the repository from GitHub. 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daisukekubota0823/ias-project-react.git
   cd ias-project-react
   ```
2. Installed the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
    ```
    npm install react react-dom react-scripts
    ```
3. Initialize the server using the command
    ```
    npm start
    ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

5. Edit the source code in the `src` directory as needed. The main entry point is `src/index.js`, 
    and you can modify components in the `src/components` directory.

6. To build the application for production, run:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
   This will create a `build` directory with the optimized production build.

7. To fund the project, you can use the following command:
    ```
    npm fund
    ```
8. To run tests, you can use:
    ```
    npm test
    ```
   This will start the test runner in watch mode.

9. To add the project on GitHub, the following steps was conducted:
    FULL WORKING STEPS
    üîπ Step 1: Confirm You're in the Right Folder
    ```
        cd ~/ias-project-react/ias-project-react
    ```
    üîπ Step 2: Confirm You‚Äôre on the Right Branch
    ```
    git branch
    ```
    If you see `master`, you need to rename it to `main`:
    ```
    git branch -m main
    ```
    üîπ Step 3: Add and Commit Your Code (if not yet done)
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    üîπ Step 4: Pull and Merge Remote Changes
    You must fetch and rebase any remote commits before pushing:
    ```
    git pull origin main --rebase
    ```
    If you encounter conflicts, resolve them:
    ```
    git add .
    git rebase --continue
    ```

    üîπ Step 5: Push Your Code
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    ‚úÖ This should now work without error!

    üßØ ALTERNATIVE (If You Want to Overwrite GitHub)
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this only if you're sure your local version is the correct one, and you want to discard what's on GitHub:
    ```
    git push -u origin main --force
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious with `--force` as it will overwrite the remote repository.

    üîç Optional Commands for Debugging
    a. See the remote:
    ```
    git remote -v

    ```
    b. Check your current branch:
    ```
    git branch
    ```
    c. View recent commit log:
    ```
    git log --oneline
    ```
    d. Check the status of your repository:
    ```
    git status
    ```
    
    ‚úÖ Final Check
    After pushing, visit your GitHub repo
